# Dinosaur Dating App 

## The first person to think of a punny name for this gets a high five from Jordan

Your team has been hired by a committee of surviving dinosaurs who are trying to rehabilitate their species on an island in the Pacific. One of their primary strategies is a dating app to help single dinos meet each other. (Turns out most dinosaurs are really shy, so an online approach works well for them.) For this first sprint, we will only use HTML and CSS. We'll come back to this later and add functionality with JavaScript. When you read the following requirements, don't worry about how to make them work- for right now, you're only concerned with how they look.

## Requirements:
- Every page should have a nav bar at the top 
- Every page should have a footer area with copyright information at the bottom.
- When users click on the "My Profile" link in the nav bar, they should see their profile and a button that says "Edit"
- Their profile should include a headshot, a bio, and a section of their interests.
- When the user clicks on the "My Matches" link in the nav bar, they should see a grid of dinosaurs that they have saved to their profile. Users should be able to see a picture of their matches and their names. (Don't worry about the functionality of saving matches- you just need to display a grid of cards with placeholder images).
- When the user clicks on the "Home" link in the nav bar, they should see one dinosaur's profile at a time. For each potential match, they should see that dinosaur's headshot, bio, and interests. 
- They should also see a button that says "Yay" and another button that says "Nay". 
- (These buttons will eventually work like swiping left and swiping right, but don't worry about functionality- just worry about            displaying a single potential match for now.)
